# Welcome to my profile

My name is Michiel Arkema, I'm 21 years old and I live in the Netherlands. I've been developing software for almost a decade, being fully self-taught. And my goal is to teach and help people to become a software developer by providing both exclusive and free content.




Here are some ideas to get you started:
