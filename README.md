# Welcome to my profile

My name is Michiel Arkema, I'm 20 years old and I live in the Netherlands. I've been developing software for 6 years, being fully self-taught. And my goal is to teach and help people to become a software developer by providing both exclusive and free content.

I'm currently a long-term intern at the RDW goverment facility of the Netherlands as a Software Engineer.


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸŽ¥ My free educational content on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYeOAjhze6_4mPWtHRNViuA).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently mainly working with: Azure DevOps, C#, Java, PHP
