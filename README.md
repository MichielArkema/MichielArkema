# Welcome to my profile

My name is Michiel Arkema, I'm 22 years old and I live in the Netherlands. I've been developing software for almost a decade, being fully self-taught. And my goal is to teach and help people to become software developers by providing both exclusive and free content.

Most of my projects are private (So invisible to you), but I'll be adding tons of projects in the coming weeks/months


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸŽ¥ My free educational content on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYeOAjhze6_4mPWtHRNViuA).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently mainly working with, PHP, and Laravel.
